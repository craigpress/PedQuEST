# PedQuEST  
**Pediatric Quantitative EEG Strategic Taskforce**

PedQuEST is an international multidisciplinary consortium dedicated to advancing brain-directed care of critically ill children using **quantitative EEG (qEEG)**. Our mission is to develop scalable infrastructure, knowledge, and research implementation pathways that enable high-quality qEEG studies and rapid translation to bedside clinical care.

## 🚀 Mission

- Advance qEEG use for clinical neuromonitoring in pediatric critical care  
- Identify clinically meaningful qEEG biomarkers  
- Standardize reporting and analytic pipelines  
- Build scalable infrastructure to support multicenter research  
- Deliver education across institutions and training levels  
- Promote collaboration, equity, and technology-driven improvement in brain care

## 🔬 Research Arm

PedQuEST developed the first **multicenter pediatric/neonatal ICU EEG research platform**, enabling secure waveform data sharing aligned with clinical data.

Key Innovation Areas:

- **Automated EEG extraction + deidentification pipeline** (Persyst + Python)
- **Cloud-based structured analytics platform (Pennsieve via Wagenaar Lab)**  
- **REDCap-linked clinical data alignment (timestamp harmonization via days from birth)**
- **Central and site-based data processing workflows**

### Core Pilot Research Aims

| Aim | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **1** | Establish a high-quality centralized EEG database to support multicenter research. With a Normative EEG Cohort |
| **2** | Identify early qEEG and clinical biomarkers of outcomes post–cardiac arrest. |
| **3** | Detect early EEG biomarkers of rare catastrophic seizure syndromes (NORSE/FIRES). |

🔹 Infrastructure supporting NIH K-awards, PERF-funded studies, and additional grant submissions in progress.
