# PedQuEST  
**Pediatric Quantitative EEG Strategic Taskforce**

PedQuEST is an international consortium dedicated to advancing **brain-directed care of critically ill children using quantitative EEG (qEEG)**. We bring together experts from leading pediatric institutions to develop scalable data infrastructure, conduct multicenter research, and support education and implementation of qEEG at the bedside.

---

## Mission

- Advance clinical use of qEEG in neurocritical care  
- Enable multicenter research using standardized data pipelines  
- Support education, collaboration, and mentorship  
- Promote equitable access to qEEG tools and data  
- Democratize data to accelerate discovery and improve outcomes

---

## What We Do

- Developed the **largest multicenter pediatric ICU EEG research platform**, using:
  - Automated EEG extraction and deidentification pipeline (Persyst + Python)  
  - **Cloud-based Pennsieve data platform (AWS)** for secure multicenter analytics  
  - REDCap-integrated clinical data mapping and quality-controlled uploads

- Support studies including:
  - **Post–cardiac arrest qEEG prognostication**
  - **Early biomarker detection in NORSE/FIRES**
  - **Automated neonatal seizure detection**
  - Integration of **COIN algorithm** into multimodal platforms

- Conduct annual scientific meetings and educational programs  
- Support investigator-initiated projects through proposal review and mentorship
