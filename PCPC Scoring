|  | 3 | Clumsy walking, understands “no” but cannot follow commands, limited gesture use and social engagement (e.g., ASD diagnosis), able to use a spoon but prefers to finger feed, assists with [...] 
|  | 4 | Not walking or running; wheelchair or stroller dependent, non-verbal with limited gestures and understanding, unable to assist with dressing, needs significant assistance and therapies (e.[...]
|  | 5 | Unable to communicate needs or interact (may startle to sounds), cannot move without assistance, requires full care for feeds (g-tube) and toileting, requires respiratory support (e.g., profo[...] 
| **3 years** | 1 | Speaking in full sentences and interactively, mostly understandable to others, independent in play, jumps off ground with both feet, undressing independently, toilet trained during[...] 
|  | 2 | Able to walk, run and navigate stairs, some arm/leg stiffness or hypertonia and uses a brace, toilet trained, speaks in phrases but hard to understand, follows multi-step commands, engages in[...] 
|  | 3 | Walks but very clumsy or needs assistive device, cannot run, has only single words and some phrases, may finger feed or use a spoon, limited social interactions (e.g., ASD diagnosis), not toi[...] 
|  | 4 | Unable to walk (wheelchair dependent), non-verbal but understands “no,” limited interactions, unable to feed self with utensils, requires g-tube feeds and respiratory support (e.g., spast[...]
