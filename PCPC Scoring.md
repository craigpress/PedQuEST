| **Age** | **PCPC Score** | **Clinical Summary / Description** |
|:---------|:--------------:|:----------------------------------|
| **1 month** | 1 | Healthy infant with normal sleep-wake cycling, normal feeding, responds to sounds and soothes when picked up; may have deficits due to non-cerebral condition (e.g., mild right arm weakness due to right shoulder dystocia) |
|  | 2 | Some weakness with head control, feeds and breathes without support, normal sleep-wake cycling (e.g., known brain anomaly on MRI and/or mild HIE with self-limited neonatal seizures on EEG) |
|  | 3 | Early right hemiparesis with early spasticity in one or two limbs, no respiratory or feeding support with normal sleep-wake cycling (e.g., perinatal left MCA stroke) |
|  | 4 | Stiffness (spasticity) in all four extremities and/or severe truncal floppiness (hypotonia), has sleep-wake cycling, cries when upset, dependent upon tube feeds and/or respiratory support (e.g., intraventricular hemorrhage with seizures that required multiple infusions) |

|  | 2 | Stands without support, does not wave bye, indiscriminate “mama” and “dada” use, communicates non-verbally with gestures (e.g., lifts arms up to be picked up), engaged and playful. Mild developmental delays, may be receiving PT, OT, or SLP. |
|  | 3 | Unable to stand without support, babbles but no "mama"/"dada", supportive therapies needed (e.g., global developmental delay diagnosis). |
|  | 4 | Sitting only with support, limited fine motor movement (raking grasp) with significant spasticity or hypotonia with dystonia, cooing but not babbling; g-tube dependent (e.g., epilepsy with significant global developmental delays). |
|  | 5 | No purposeful movements or interactions, need several technological supports including respiratory support while sleeping and g-tube dependent (e.g., significant traumatic brain injury). |
| **2 years** | 1 | Running, two-word phrases and uses gestures (e.g., points), engages well with peers, feeds self with a spoon, assists with dressing, able to pull off clothing, no delays noted. |
|  | 2 | Mild arm weakness from stroke, able to walk, clumsy running, speaking, understands "no" and follows simple commands, feeding with a spoon, assists with dressing, not toilet training. |
|  | 3 | Clumsy walking, understands "no" but cannot follow commands, limited gesture use and social engagement (e.g., ASD diagnosis), able to use a spoon but prefers to finger feed, assisting with dressing and not toilet training, requires therapies for global developmental impairment. |
|  | 4 | Not walking or running; wheelchair or stroller dependent, non-verbal with limited gestures and understanding, unable to assist with dressing, needs significant assistance and therapies (e.g., severe spastic quadriplegia). |
|  | 5 | Unable to communicate needs or interact (may startle to sounds), cannot move without assistance, requires full care for feeds (g-tube) and toileting, requires respiratory support (e.g., profound brain injury due to near-drowning). |
| **3 years** | 1 | Speaking in full sentences and interactively, mostly understandable to others, independent in play, jumps off ground with both feet, undressing independently, and toilet trained during the day. |
|  | 2 | Able to walk, run and navigate stairs, has some arm and leg stiffness/hypertonia and uses a brace, toilet trained during the day, speaks in phrases and sentences but difficult to understand, follows multi-step commands, and engages in interactive play. |
|  | 3 | Walks but very clumsy or needs an assistive device, cannot run, has only single words and some phrases, may be able to finger feed or use a spoon, may have limited social interactions with peers and restricted interests (e.g., ASD diagnosis), not toilet trained during the day. |
|  | 4 | Unable to walk (wheelchair dependent), non-verbal but understands "no," limited interactions, unable to feed self with utensils, requires g-tube feeds and respiratory support (e.g., diagnosis of spastic CP or profound intellectual disability). |
|  | 5 | No voluntary or purposeful movements, limited interactions, with full dependence on caregivers, g-tube fed and requiring respiratory support (e.g., progressive neurodegenerative metabolic disorder). |
| **4–5 years** | 1 | Walks, runs, jumps. Follows complex instructions, plays cooperatively, demonstrates curiosity and learning. |
|  | 2 | Speaks in short but full sentences, attention difficulties and/or hyperactivity requiring minor supports (504 accommodations) at school. |
|  | 3 | Speaks in phrases and short sentences, not fully understandable; has trouble with multistep commands; toilet trained, largely able to undress but needs some assistance with dressing; needs special education at school and has an IEP (e.g., moderate intellectual disability, ASD). |
|  | 4 | Non-verbal with limited interactions (smiles and cries in response to stimulus), and wheelchair dependent for movement, highly dependent on assistance for all ADLs and may require respiratory support for part of the day (e.g., non-verbal ASD, moderate to profound intellectual disability, quadriplegic CP). |
|  | 5 | Severe CP, unresponsive to environment; non-verbal, dependent on g-tube feeds, no voluntary movement only reflexic movements/dystonia, requires some respiratory support. |
| **6–12 years** | 1 | Age-appropriate performance in school, involved in extracurricular activities, no developmental concerns. |
|  | 2 | May be clumsy but no additional mobility concerns, able to tell stories and follow multi-step commands, may have attention and/or learning differences requiring 504 supports at school, able to complete most self-care skills (e.g., feeding, dressing, toileting) but may need parental supervision (e.g., ADHD, speech delay, mild ASD). |
|  | 3 | Requires some assistance/modifications for physical activities, able to communicate verbally but not at same level as peers, difficulty with school requiring special education or IEP (e.g., moderate intellectual disability, moderate to severe ASD or CP). |
|  | 4 | Profound mobility restrictions (requiring a wheelchair), non-verbal, fully dependent on caregivers for all self-care activities and may be g-tube fed, may require respiratory support. |
|  | 5 | No purposeful movements or interactions, g-tube and respiratory support needs (e.g., post anoxic brain injury; minimally conscious state). |
| **> 12 years** | 1 | Teenager with typical development, preparing for college, involved in extracurricular activities, no neurodevelopmental concerns. |

|  | 3 | IEP-based supports for learning disabilities or cognitive deficits (mild to moderate intellectual disability), limited verbal communication, requires structured daily routines and supports (e.g., moderate ASD), expected to graduate from high school but may not be in diploma track. |
|  | 4 | Profound mobility restrictions (requiring a wheelchair); non-verbal; fully dependent on caregivers for all self-care activities and may be g-tube fed, may require respiratory support (e.g., severe neurodegenerative disorder with progressive decline). |
|  | 5 | Minimally conscious state (aka persistent vegetative state) without purposeful interactions or movements, g-tube and respiratory support needs (e.g., severe traumatic brain injury in late adolescence). |
